				<h2 class="norm">To sell your property fast, you just need to do 3 things:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Get a <strong>broker</strong> who will educate and assist you through the process.</li>
					<li>Post your listing on a platform that will allow you to put your property <strong>in front of as many people</strong> as possible.</li>
					<li>Set your <strong>price at below market value</strong> to attract buyers to consider your property.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>And until you decide to begin doing all three, you’ll be stuck playing the costly waiting game.</p>
				<p>Some say, they can wait. So they go on <strong>asking how long will it take</strong>.</p>
				<p>This is one of the most common questions that sellers ask us. And the unsatisfying answer is <strong>“it depends”</strong>.</p>
				
				<hr class="line-city-red">
					<h2 class="text-center bordered text-red">The fact is that in a balanced market, it takes approximately 6 months to sell a property – and that’s with a broker.</h2>
				<hr class="short-red m-b-md">

				<p>Typically, it’s best to assume that you’re not going to get an offer until <strong>roughly 20 buyers</strong> have been through your home. And then from there, assume that <strong>it will take 2-3 offers before a deal is done</strong>.</p>
				<p>If you the patience wait that long, and the willingness to service those buyer inquiries and tour them in your property, then you can do just that. Just <strong>be prepared for all the paperwork</strong> that comes afterwards.</p>
