				<p>You can overcome these limitations once you realize that <strong>real estate brokering is a numbers game</strong>. You can easily change your situation by focusing your time on two things:</p>
				<ul class="list-house">
					<li>Increasing the number of prospective buyers for each listing.</li>
					<li>Increasing the number of seller listings you can handle.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>How can you do that when you barely have enough time to juggle the listings you have now? So much of your time is spent entertaining possible clients, that these days you barely have enough time, even for yourself.</p>
				<p>The whole sales process is a long one… and often has to be repeated multiple times.</p>
				<p><strong>It’s exhausting. We understand.</strong></p>
				<p>And because of this, we need to remember that...</p>
