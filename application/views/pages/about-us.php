				<h1 class="text-center text-red m-b-md">How We Got Started</h1>
				<p>Being in the real estate field, we’ve come across a lot of frustrated property owners who needed to quickly sell their properties. We’ve heard their stories. There were those who were moving abroad for a business or a job. Some were unable to continue paying off the mortgage and interest on their home loans. There were entrepreneurs who needed the extra funds from the property sale to set up their own company. Some were OFW’s, with rarely used condo units, who just didn’t want to continue paying realty taxes and association dues. The list goes on...</p>
				<p>A lot of them were willing to sell their properties at discounted prices to speed up the sale. Being investors ourselves, we felt that a lot of these were good deals as property investments. We wanted to help them in some way. We figured out that there had to be an easier way for these people to connect with ready cash buyers and investors.</p>
				<p>This led us to develop REDLIST – an online platform service that specializes in matching discounted rush-sale properties to interested buyer-investors in the shortest amount of time.</p>

				<h1 class="text-center text-red m-b-md">Who We Are</h1>
				<p>We know how difficult it is to invest in real estate here in the Philippines.</p>
				<p>When we first started out a few years ago, we were in over our heads trying to figure out the real estate game. There was no one to mentor us or point us to the right way. We found out that real estate game was very competitive.  A lot successful real estate investors won’t share their secrets with  newbies. However, we here at Redlist believe that knowledge should be shared.</p>
				<p>We know exactly how it feels; we’ve gone through the same thing. The confusion that comes when you’re left alone to figure out concepts and processes you don’t understand; the frustration of not being able to get a good deal on a property; the exhaustion that comes from touring buyers who will only leave you disappointed in the end.</p>
				<p>We’ve been there. And we want to help.</p>
